                      <p>Change is in the air. After almost 30 years, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) is near the end of Phase 2 of our international MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) research program, and on track to launch our much larger, multi-site Phase 3 trials in 2017. "These are exciting times building on work of many decades," writes MAPS Founder and Executive Director Rick Doblin, Ph.D., in the Winter 2015 MAPS Bulletin. "We have the real potential to make transformative progress not just within our own lifetimes, but in the near future."</p>
                      <p>On December 4, 2015, the last participant received their final experimental treatment in our Phase 2 study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for 23 subjects with chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD in Boulder, Colorado. We have already raised 94% of the funds we need to complete this study, with only $44,000 needed. Thanks to two generous donors, we have the opportunity to match the first $7,000 donated to complete this study. Please give now to double your gift so we can complete this vital study.</p>
                      <p>Last month, three new subjects participated in our ongoing Phase 1 study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for therapists in training to conduct clinical MDMA research. "It was such an incredible experience to be able to train in this exciting new type of therapy," reports Mat Hoskins, MBBS (M.D.), who is developing an upcoming fMRI neuroimaging study of the effects of MDMA on the brains of people with PTSD, to be sponsored in part by MAPS. "I've learnt so much from the therapists, but also from the experience of MDMA in a clinical setting…I feel confident and competent to support our study participants through their own experience."</p>

                      <p>On December 4, 2015, the last subject received their final experimental treatment in our Phase 2 study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for 23 subjects with chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD in Boulder, Colorado. This study has enrolled a total of 29 subjects, with six dropouts. Each participant who completed this study received three experimental MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions along with multiple preparatory and integrative psychotherapy sessions. Primary outcome data is collected four weeks following each subject’s second session, when the subjects and therapists are unblinded. Subject scores on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) following the unblinded third session will not be included in the primary statistical analysis, and is intended to provide additional data to guide the design of our upcoming Phase 3 trials. “For the first time in my life, I was able to face my worst fears and memories with the quiet knowledge that they could no longer reach out and destroy me,” reports Hania Sakal, who participated in the trial. “The certainty was absolute: with the help of MDMA and the therapists who were there to witness and guide my journey, I was safe from harm and from the people in my past who no longer had the power to hurt me.” The final results will begin to be prepared for publication in early 2016, with publication expected in late 2016.</p>

                      <h2>Therapist Training: Three Participants Receive MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy</h2>
                      <p>From November 11-13, 2015, three new subjects were treated in our ongoing Phase 1 study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for therapists in training to conduct clinical trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD. Led by Principal Investigator Michael Mithoefer, M.D., this study is designed as a placebo-controlled, double-blind study to assess the psychological effects of MDMA when administered to healthy volunteers. These participants included Ben Sessa, MBBS (M.D.), Mathew Hoskins, MBBS (M.D.), and Chrissie Wilson, BSc., who are preparing for an upcoming fMRI neuroimaging study of the effects of MDMA on the brains of people with PTSD, co-sponsored by MAPS, The Beckley Foundation, Anton Bilton, and the Mosley Foundation.</p>
                      <p>"It was such an incredible experience to be able to train in this exciting new type of therapy,” reports Dr. Hoskins. “I've learnt so much from the therapists, but also from the experience of MDMA in a clinical setting. As a result we've changed the timings of our own protocol, and I feel confident and competent to support our study participants through their own experience." This study has now treated 10 participants since it began in 2010. In preparation for Phase 3 of our MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD development program, we are currently updating the protocol to request approval for a multi-center study, with a new location in Boulder, Colorado, under the direction of Marcela Ot’alora, in order to increase enrollment to cover training needs over the next five years.</p>

We will close enrollment at the end of this month in order to gather the data for submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as part of our End-of-Phase 2 meeting, in preparation for Phase 3.</p>

Led by Principal Investigator Michael Mithoefer, M.D., and Co-Therapist Annie Mithoefer, B.S.N., in Charleston, South Carolina, the data from this study are now being prepared for analysis and publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. “When we applied to the FDA for our first study in October 2001, primarily aimed at treating people with crime-related trauma such as childhood sexual abuse, rape, or other assault, we didn’t know that the Afghanistan and Iraq wars would be starting soon,” writes Dr. Mithoefer in his all-new article in the Winter 2015 MAPS Bulletin. “Since then, the need for additional treatments for returning veterans with PTSD has become painfully and increasingly pressing.”</p>

                      <p>On November 30, 2015, the sixth subject received their first experimental treatment in our ongoing study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for anxiety associated with life-threatening illness. This subject was enrolled on November 4. Led by Principal Investigator Phil Wolfson, M.D., with co-therapist Julane Andries, LMFT, in Marin, Calif., this study will treat 18 subjects suffering from anxiety related to a life-threatening disease that is either ongoing or in remission with a possibility of recurrence. “I lost my oldest son Noah to leukemia when he was nearly 17. He taught me about the passion to live and to try anything, no matter how difficult, to keep his life going,” recalls Dr. Wolfson in his Winter 2015 MAPS Bulletin article. “Our current study with 18 subjects embraces Noah’s path. His inspiration guides my work with those who struggle with life-threatening illnesses.” We currently expect all experimental sessions in this study will be completed in late 2016.</p>

                      <p>On November 14, 2015, the 10th participant was treated in our ongoing study of MDMA-assisted therapy for social anxiety in 12 adults on the autism spectrum. The 11th subject was enrolled on November 15. We plan to enroll one final subject in this study. “Unlike the PTSD studies, the social anxiety study includes interactions with the researchers that are intended to boost social confidence and provide practice opportunities to try new social skills in a safe setting,” report Principal Investigator Charles Grob, M.D., and Co-Investigator Alicia Danforth, Ph.D., in their new Winter 2015 MAPS Bulletin article. “Additionally, participants complete a video-based assessment of non-verbal social cues that involves watching actors in various social interactions.” Sponsored by MAPS, this is a collaborative study between MAPS and the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, with blood plasma biomarker analysis being conducted by researchers at Stanford University.</p>

                      <p>Over 230 people gave nearly $270,000 in the month of November 2015 to support MAPS’ psychedelic and medical marijuana research and education programs. We thank everyone who contributed, no matter the amount. A special thank you goes to all those who generously lead the way for psychedelic science:</p>

                      <p>MAPS relies on the generosity of individual donors to achieve our mission. Research into the beneficial potential of psychedelics is again being conducted under federal guidelines, but no funding for psychedelic therapy research is yet available from governments or major foundations. That means that the future of psychedelic and marijuana research depends on individual donors and family foundations. Please consider making a gift today.</p>
